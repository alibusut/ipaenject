# ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

## üîß General Questions

### Q: What is Universal iOS App Patcher?
**A:** It's an automated system that uses GitHub Actions to modify iOS apps by injecting tweaks (dylibs) and re-signing them for sideloading.

### Q: Is this legal?
**A:** The tool itself is legal for educational and personal use. However, you must:
- Own the original application
- Comply with app terms of service
- Follow your local copyright laws
- Use for personal purposes only

### Q: Do I need a jailbroken device?
**A:** No! Modified apps work on non-jailbroken devices when installed via sideloading tools like AltStore or Sideloadly.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Questions

### Q: How do I get started?
**A:** 
1. Fork this repository
2. Enable GitHub Actions with write permissions
3. Run the "Build Modified iOS App" workflow
4. Provide an IPA URL and select your tweaks

### Q: Where do I get decrypted IPA files?
**A:** You need to obtain these yourself from:
- Your own apps using tools like Clutch or frida-ios-dump
- Apps you've purchased and own
- **Note:** We cannot provide these for legal reasons

### Q: Can I add my own tweaks?
**A:** Yes! Place `.dylib` files in the appropriate `tweaks/` directory and update the manifest. See CONTRIBUTING.md for details.

## üì± Build Questions

### Q: Why is my build failing?
**A:** Common causes:
- Invalid IPA URL (not direct download)
- Corrupted or encrypted IPA file
- Incompatible tweaks for the app version
- GitHub Actions timeout

### Q: How long does building take?
**A:** Typically 5-15 minutes depending on:
- IPA file size
- Number of tweaks being injected
- GitHub Actions queue

### Q: Can I build multiple apps at once?
**A:** Each workflow run builds one app, but you can run multiple workflows simultaneously.

## üîê Signing Questions

### Q: What's the difference between free and developer signing?
**A:**
- **Free signing**: 7-day expiration, requires regular refresh
- **Developer signing**: 1-year expiration, requires paid Apple Developer account

### Q: Why does my app expire after 7 days?
**A:** Free Apple ID certificates expire after 7 days. Use AltStore's auto-refresh feature or get a paid developer account.
